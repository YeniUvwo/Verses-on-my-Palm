    <h2>Final Declaration</h2>
    <p>I am armed with the Word of God.<br>
    It is my sword, my shield, my strength.<br>
    When I am weak, it is my comfort.<br>
    When I am lost, it is my compass.<br>
    When I face battle, it is my victory.<br><br>
    I walk in faith, not by sight.<br>
    I stand in truth. I live by His Word.<br><br>
    <strong>Thank You Jesus!</strong></p>
